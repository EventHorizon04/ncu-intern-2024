# WiFi-Based Human Pose Estimation

## Overview
This project apply a novel approach model, WiFi-TCN[^1], to human pose estimation using WiFi signals, offering a privacy-preserving alternative to traditional camera-based systems. By analyzing WiFi signal patterns and their interactions with human bodies, the system can detect and track human poses in indoor environments.

## Technical Details
The system utilizes:
- Channel State Information (CSI) from WiFi signals
- Advanced signal processing algorithms
- Advanced deep learning techinuq such as attention mechanism, bidirectional LSTM, etc.
