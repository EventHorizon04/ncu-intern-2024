## WiFi-Based Human Pose Estimation

This project implements a novel approach model, TCN-AA [WiFi-TCN: Temporal Convolution for Human Interaction Recognition Based on WiFi Signal], to human pose estimation using WiFi signals, offering a privacy-preserving alternative to traditional camera-based systems. By analyzing WiFi signal patterns and their interactions with human bodies, the system can detect and track human poses in indoor environments.
